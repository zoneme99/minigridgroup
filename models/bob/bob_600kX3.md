# BOB - 600k X3 
Bob was train on 600k X 3 steps (1.8m steps total)
Bob can capture and retrieve the enemy flag most of the games and 
he can even do it on v2 aka a version trained 600k X2. 

I tried training a version on 400k X2 steps but that version 
hade a very low chance of scoring so the magic seem to happen 
around 1m-1.2m steps. This should give you an agent capable 
of solving a 21x21 sized game.
